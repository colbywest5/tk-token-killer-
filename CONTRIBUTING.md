## Command Guidelines

When adding or modifying commands:

1. **Load _shared.md** - All commands should import shared behaviors
2. **Support modes** - light/medium/heavy where applicable
3. **Document clearly** - Each command needs clear usage examples
4. **Enforce rules** - Check .tk/RULES.md before generating code
5. **Update help.md** - Add new commands to the help list
6. **Update plugin.json** - Add to the commands array

## Code Style

- Keep prompts concise (we're optimizing for tokens)
- No emojis in code or output
- No placeholder code
- Clear, actionable instructions

## Testing

Test your changes locally before submitting:

```bash
# Test the command in Claude Code
/tk:your-command light
/tk:your-command medium
/tk:your-command heavy
```

## Commit Messages
