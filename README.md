## Why This Exists

If you don't hit your token limit daily are you even doing anything? 

The best AI coding workflows—[Get Shit Done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done), [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph), Anthropic's official plugins—each solve different problems. TK combines their best patterns into one cohesive toolkit:

- **Structured workflows** — 7-phase build process, not chaos
- **Parallel agents** — Multiple specialists working simultaneously  
- **Context engineering** — Fresh context, no degradation
- **Security scanning** — Catch vulnerabilities before they ship
- **Rules enforcement** — Your standards, every time

## Commands

<div align="center">

![TK Workflow](assets/workflow.svg)

</div>

<br>

### Core Workflow

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/tk:map` | **Run this first.** Scans your codebase, creates `AGENTS.md` with project context, sets up `.planning/` directory. |
| `/tk:build` | Builds features using a 7-phase workflow: Discovery → Exploration → Questions → Architecture → Implementation → Review → Summary |
| `/tk:qa` | Tests your code with security vulnerability scanning for injection, XSS, secrets, and more. |
| `/tk:deploy` | Deploys with pre-flight checks and post-deploy verification. Auto-rollback on failure. |

### Quality & Maintenance

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/tk:debug` | Systematic debugging. Hypothesis testing, auto-revert on failures, escalation when stuck. |
| `/tk:review` | Code review with 4 parallel reviewers. Only reports high-confidence issues. |
| `/tk:clean` | Removes dead code, unused deps, console.logs. Refactors for clarity. |
| `/tk:design` | Creates distinctive frontend interfaces—unique typography, bold colors, no AI slop. |

### Configuration

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/tk:rules` | **Set global rules for all agents.** No emojis, no placeholders, no browser popups, etc. Rules are enforced on every command. |

### Documentation & Analysis

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/tk:doc` | Generates README, API docs, architecture diagrams, inline comments. |
| `/tk:workflow` | **Visual workflow documentation.** Generates self-contained HTML with SVG diagrams, executive summaries, data flow analysis, real-world examples, and improvement recommendations. Perfect for team onboarding or architecture reviews. |
| `/tk:opinion` | **Honest project audit.** Asks questions, then gives direct feedback on architecture, code quality, dependencies, testing, docs, and MVP progress. |
| `/tk:init` | Scaffolds new projects with your preferred stack and tooling. |
| `/tk:resume` | Picks up where you left off if interrupted. |
| `/tk:learn` | Captures gotchas, patterns, and decisions. |
| `/tk:status` | Quick health check: git, tests, types, build. |
| `/tk:tokens` | Shows token usage estimates. |
| `/tk:help` | Shows all commands. |

---

## Modes

Every command supports three modes:

| Mode | When to use | What happens |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `light` | Quick fixes, simple tasks | Fast, minimal questions, no SubAgents |
| `medium` | Standard features | Balanced, 2-3 questions, structured |
| `heavy` | Complex features | Full workflow, parallel SubAgents + DOCS |

```bash
/tk:build light    # Just build it
/tk:build medium   # Ask questions, then build
/tk:build heavy    # Full 7-phase with parallel agents
```

---

## `/tk:rules` — Global Agent Rules

Set rules that ALL TK agents must follow:

```bash
/tk:rules              # Interactive setup
/tk:rules add <rule>   # Add a single rule
/tk:rules list         # Show current rules
```

**Example rules:**
- No emojis in output or code
- No placeholder code (TODO, FIXME, "implement later")
- No browser popups (alert, confirm, prompt)
- No console.log in production code
- All async operations must have error handling
- Use conventional commit format

Rules are stored in `.tk/RULES.md` and enforced on every command.

**Default rules (always apply):**
```
- No placeholder code
- No hardcoded secrets
- No browser popups
- Error handling required for async
```

---

## `/tk:opinion` — Project Audit

Get honest, actionable feedback on your project:

```bash
/tk:opinion medium
```

**What it checks:**
- Architecture — Is the structure sensible? Any anti-patterns?
- Code Quality — Consistency, dead code, error handling
- Dependencies — Bloat, security issues, outdated packages
- Testing — Coverage, meaningful tests, CI integration
- Documentation — Can someone new get started?
- MVP Progress — How far off are you? Any scope creep?

**What you get:**
- What's working (specific praise)
- What's not working (direct feedback)
- What to stop doing (time wasters)
- What to start doing (high-impact changes)
- Hot takes (things you might not want to hear)

---

## Heavy Mode SubAgents

When using `heavy` mode, TK spawns specialized SubAgents in parallel:

| Command | SubAgents |
|---------|-----------|
| `map` | 6 mappers + DOCS |
| `build` | 3 explorers → 3 architects → 3 reviewers + DOCS |
| `workflow` | 1 mapper + 1 diagrammer + 1 analyst + 1 OSI specialist + 1 metrics + DOCS |
| `opinion` | 4 auditors (architecture, code, deps, DX) + DOCS |
| `design` | 3 researchers + 4 specialists + DOCS |
| `debug` | 4 investigators + 3 fixers + DOCS |
| `qa` | 6 specialists (security, edge cases, perf, a11y) + DOCS |
| `review` | 4 reviewers + DOCS |
| `deploy` | 4 pre-flight + 4 post-deploy + DOCS |

---

## `/tk:workflow` — Visual Documentation

Generate comprehensive, self-contained HTML documentation with visual diagrams, analytical charts, and OSI model analysis:

```bash
/tk:workflow heavy How does the authentication flow work?
/tk:workflow medium Document the payment processing system
```

**What it generates:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dual-Page Output** | Full Analysis + Executive Summary views with navigation |
| **OSI Model Analysis** | Maps all components to OSI layers 1-7 with visual diagram |
| **Analytical Charts** | Pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, sparklines (pure SVG) |
| **PDF Export** | One-click export button on both pages |
| **Architecture Diagrams** | System overview, data flow, component interactions |
| **Executive Summary** | Condensed view for stakeholders and leadership |
| **Improvement Recommendations** | Prioritized suggestions with business impact |
| **Secrets Redaction** | Auto-redacts API keys, passwords, tokens (security-first) |
| **Professional Icons** | SVG icons only, no emojis |

**Output files:**
| Mode | Output |
|------|--------|
| `light` | `workflow-overview.html` — Quick overview + main diagram |
| `medium` | `workflow-full.html` + `workflow-executive.html` — Dual-page with charts |
| `heavy` | Full dual-page output with OSI analysis + parallel SubAgents |

**Charts included:**
- Component distribution (pie)
- Components per OSI layer (bar)
- Dependency complexity trend (line)
- Code distribution (pie)
- Inline sparklines for metrics

**Use cases:**
- Team doesn't understand how a system works
- Onboarding new developers
- Executive briefings on technical systems
- Pre-refactor analysis
- Knowledge transfer
- Network layer analysis

**Security & Quality:**
- Secrets auto-redacted (API keys, passwords, tokens, connection strings)
- No emojis — professional SVG icons only
- SVG validation ensures clean rendering (no black box artifacts)

## `/tk:build` — 7-Phase Workflow

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 1. Discovery | Understand requirements, create task list |
| 2. Exploration | Trace existing patterns, identify key files |
| 3. Questions | **Mandatory.** Resolve all ambiguities before design |
| 4. Architecture | Multiple approaches → trade-offs → you choose |
| 5. Implementation | Build with approval, follow conventions |
| 6. Review | Check bugs, quality, conventions (≥80% confidence) |
| 7. Summary | Document what was built |

---

## `/tk:qa` — Security Scanning

| Vulnerability | What TK checks |
|---------------|----------------|
| Command injection | `exec()`, `child_process`, `os.system()` |
| Code injection | `eval()`, `new Function()` |
| XSS | `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |
| Secrets | Hardcoded passwords, API keys |
| Dependencies | `npm audit` vulnerabilities |
| GitHub Actions | `${{ }}` injection in workflows |

---

## MCP Integration

TK supports the Model Context Protocol:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["Toolkit", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
